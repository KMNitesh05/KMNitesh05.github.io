- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nitesh Kumar (@KMNitesh05) PhD Candidate, Washington State University, Pullman.

I am interested in the intersection of interfacial chemistry of fluids, nuclear chemistry, and computer science. My first research focus was the molecular simulation of biopolymers(protein-water interactions), working at UDelhi. Since then, I am working on separation and solvent organization at liquid/liquid interfaces in general and developing tools to do so from computer science and chemistry. These topics include classical molecular dynamics simulations, ab-initio molecular dynamics and state of art topological network analysis using graph theory. In the future, I am interested in translating my knowledge and skills into separation chemistry and energy applications working at Washington State University.
