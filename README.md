- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nitesh Kumar (@KMNitesh05) PhD Candidate, Washington State University, Pullman.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computational Chemistry and Network Theory

I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, interfacial chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and computer science. My first research focus was the molecular simulation of biopolymers(protein-water interactions), working at UDelhi. Since then, I have been working on understanding chemical transport and organization at liquid/liquid interfaces and developing tools for chemical data analysis. My research involves classical molecular dynamics simulations, ab-initio molecular dynamics, and state-of-the-art topological network analysis using graph theory. In the future, I am interested in translating my knowledge and skills into soft-matter chemistry and energy applications.
