<h3 id="research-interests">Research interests</h3>

<p>I am interested in developing methods in machine learning that are driven by the distinct challenges and opportunities in the natural sciences, with particular interest in physics-inspired machine learning methods. 
Some areas of exploration include approaches to incorporate physical inductive biases (such as symmetries, conservation laws) into ML models to improve generalization for scientific problems, the advantages that ML can bring to classical physics-based numerical solvers (such as through end-to-end differentiable frameworks and implicit layers), and better learning strategies for distribution shifts in the physical sciences.
These methods are informed by and grounded in applications in atomistic and continuum problems, including fluid mechanics, molecular dynamics, materials design, climate science, and other related areas.
This work also includes interfacing with other fields including numerical methods, dynamical systems theory, quantum mechanical simulations, computational geometry, and optimization. Our <a href="https://physics4ml.github.io/">“Physics4ML” workshop</a> at ICLR 2023 encompasses many of the research topics of interest.</p>

<p>Some examples of recent work include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Developing a differentiable PDE-constrained layer to exactly enforce the relevant physics for a given problem, which can be added to any neural network and trained end-to-end via implicit differentiation. This approach provides significantly greater control and accuracy in enforcing PDE constraints, compared to approaches that enforce the relevant constraints solely through the loss function (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08675">International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)</a>; 2023),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrating numerical methods validation approaches for neural networks to model continuous dynamical systems (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08494">arXiv:2202.08494</a>; 2022),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Characterizing the challenges associated with incorporating fundamental physical laws into the machine learning process (i.e., ‘‘physics-informed neural networks’’), and devising strategies to overcome their failure modes by changing the learning paradigm (<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/df438e5206f31600e6ae4af72f2725f1-Abstract.html">Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</a>; 2021),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representation learning through mapping data into topological descriptors (invariant to homeomorphic transformations of the domain), for better accuracy and interpretability in renewable energy applications (structure-property relationships in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c01167">nanoporous</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88027-8">materials</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05290">proteins</a>),</p>
  </li>
</ul>
